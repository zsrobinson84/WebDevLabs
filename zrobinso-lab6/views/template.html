                I am a sophmore at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems. I am currently taking two IS classes: 67-270 and 67-272, both focused on web developement. In my free time, I like to read, listen to music, and play video games. My favorite game is Teamfight Tactics, but I also like to play Minecraft with my friends. At school, I am a part of a club called Carnegie Mellon Racing, where we build two fully electric racecars each year.
